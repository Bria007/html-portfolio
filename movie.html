 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</h3>
 <p>My faviorite movie of ever. This movies provides a nostalgia that brings be back to being a child in elementary seeing it for the first time and it felt like freedom.</p>

<h3>Don't Look Up</h3>
<p>Hilarious and timeless since its always so relevant to the times as people don't chose to believe truth regradless of facts and I don't see that changing</p>

<h3>Life</h3>
<p>This was just a classic movie that I watched as a kid. I watched it too many times and can't watch it now. </p>
